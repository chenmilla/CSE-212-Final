# Stack

## Introduction
Since there are many ways to implement solutions for today's coding problems, there are some solutions that are better than others. That is when Big-O notation enters in actoin. We need to understand it first to know which data structure to implement.

Big-O notation ilustrates how complex or how fast a function will run in Python. For example in the above picture, O(1) is the fastes one since only takes one step to get the result. Howerver, O(n!) is the less efficient of all of the operations because take more steps to get the result. In other words, we should try to work closer to the "x-axis" to have a better performance for our code. With this in mind, we can go ahead and learn about Stacks.  

## Characteristics of Stacks

* Stacks are linear data structre, which means its Big O notaion is O(n). 
* Stacks are similar to list since it stores data in an order. 
* Stacks follows LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, meaning you can only add or delete an element at the top.

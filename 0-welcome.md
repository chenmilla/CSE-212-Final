#Welcome
Hi there! This is a tutorial that will help you to learn more about data structure. I will cover
3 data structures: Stack, Sets, and Tree. In each data structure, I will give an explanation of what they are and how they work. Further, I will give an example
where you can learn more about the data structure. Finally, I will give you a problem where you will put in practice what you just read. I will provide you a 
link for the solution where you can compare your solution with mine.

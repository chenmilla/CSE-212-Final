# Tree

## Introduction
When I was a kid, I did not have a play station or a computer where I could play video games. Also, I did not have Cable T.V. so, so I used to spend most of my free time playing with my friend outdoors. I remember once we were pretending to have a tree house. As I was climbing a tree, one of its branches hit my eye, but I did not notice it until a friend told me that I had blood on my face. After looking at myself in a side mirror of a car, I got super scared since I did not know if I have lost my eye or how deep the injury was. My mom took me to the hospital where they aided me. I had a successful recovery and nothing serious happened to me. However, we are not talking about these kinds of trees.

## BST Operations

### INSERTING INTO A BST




### TRAVERSING A BST

## BST IN PYTHON
 
| Common Stack Operation | Description | Big-O Notation |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| insert(v)              | Inserts the value "v" into the tree |  O(log n) |
| remove(v)              | Remove the value "v" from the tree. |  O(log n) |
| contains(v) | 	Determine if a value is in the tree. | O(log n) |
| traverse_forward | Visit all objects from smallest to largest. | O(n)) |
| traverse_reverse | Visit all objects from largest to smallest. | O(n) |
| height(node) | Determine the height of a node. If the height of the tree is needed, the root node is provided.. | O(n) |
| size() | Return the size of the BST. | O(1) |
| empty() | Returns true if the root node is empty. This can also be done by checking the size for 0. | O(1) |
